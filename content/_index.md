## About the BAPC

The Benelux Algorithm Programming Contest (BAPC) is a contest in which teams from leading universities in Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands are served a series of algorithmic problems/puzzles. The goal of each team is to solve the most puzzles as possible within the set time limit. Solutions need to be programmed out on a computer and can be submitted to a semi-automated judging system, after which the solution is checked.

The teams that have solved the most puzzles at the end of the contest qualify for the [Northwestern European Regional Contest (NWERC)](https://www.nwerc.eu). In this regional competition the teams can qualify themselves for a ticket to the [International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](https://icpc.global), also known as the World Finals.

The BAPC 2021 is hosted by [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://www.vu.nl/), and organized by a committee of [study association STORM](https://storm.vu).
