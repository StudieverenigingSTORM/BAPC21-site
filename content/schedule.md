# Schedule

The schedule of the day itself is still uncertain. The schedule of this year looks something like this:

- Month 04, discussion with other associations on when the preliminaries can be held (organized by individual universities).
- Month 06, possibly preliminaries
- Month 09, the preliminaries
- Month 10, BAPC21

This planning is subject to change as the Benelux still faces problems with COVID-19.
