# Registration

The registration will open after the preliminaries have taken place. 

There are a limited amount of slots per institution available for teams and there are usually more teams than slots. Therefore preliminaries can be held in your institution to determine which teams qualify for the BAPC 2021. The preliminaries are expected to be held in the summer of 2021. 

Registration for a preliminary at your institution is independent of a registration for BAPC21. Information on how to register a team representing your university is often arranged via your teaching staff or the study association representing either the mathematics or computer science department.
