# Registration

Registration will be opened after the preliminaries has finished. The preliminaries are expected to be held in the summer of 2021.

Registration for a preliminary is independent of registration for BAPC21. Info on how the register for a team representing your own university/school is mostly registered via your teaching staff or the study association representing either the Mathematic or Computer Science department.
