# Registration

The registration will be opened after the preliminaries has finished. The preliminaries are expected to be held in the summer of 2021.

Signing up for a preliminary at your institution is independent of a registration for BAPC21. Info on how to register a team representing your own university/school is often arranged via your teaching staff or the study association representing either the math or computer science department.
