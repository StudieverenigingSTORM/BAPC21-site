# Registration

The registration will open after the preliminaries have taken place. 

## Preliminaries

The slots per institution for BAPC21 are limited. As there tends to be more teams than slots available, your institution can hold preliminary contests to determine which teams qualify for BAPC21. The preliminaries will hold on **9 October 2021**.

Registration for a preliminary at your institution is independent of a registration for BAPC21. Information on how to register a team representing your university is often arranged via your teaching staff or the study association representing either the mathematics or computer science department.

### Locations of preliminaries
